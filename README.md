# Setup
You need to do 2 things to use this non-certified connector.
1. Go to settings inside Power BI desktop, and allow any extension to run: File > Options and Settings > Options > Security (under global) > "(Not Reccomended) Allow any extension to load without validation or warning"
2. Download .mez file and place it in your Power BI custom connectors folder. If you do not have a folder at ..Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors then create that folder sturcture first.
