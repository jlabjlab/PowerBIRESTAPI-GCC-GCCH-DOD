# PowerBIRESTAPI-GCCH
All credit to https://github.com/migueesc123/PowerBIRESTAPI for the original code. 

This fork modifies the code to work with GCCH (GCC High) endpoints.
This version will only work with GCCH Tennants.

If you need a GCC or DoD version please let me know. 

# Setup
You need to do 2 things to use this non-certified connector.
1. Go to settings inside Power BI desktop, and allow any extension to run: File > Options and Settings > Options > Security (under global) > "(Not Reccomended) Allow any extension to load without validation or warning"
2. Put [.mez file](https://github.com/migueesc123/PowerBIRESTAPI/raw/master/Power%20BI%20API.mez) and place it in your Power BI custom connectors folder. If you do not have a folder at ..Documents\Power BI Desktop\Custom Connectors then create that folder sturcture first. 

Please see main project page for additional instructions. https://github.com/migueesc123/PowerBIRESTAPI
